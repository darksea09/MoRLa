Measurement of Reservoir Level from altimetry (MoRLa)

The Measurement of Reservoir Level from Altimetry (MoRLa) program is an automated system designed to extract reservoir level information from altimetry satellite data in unmeasured or undisclosed areas. This program utilizes four satellites, namely CryoSat-2, IceSat-2, Sentinel-3A, and 3B, equipped with four unique and creative filters to enhance both the density and accuracy of the data.
When applying these filters, users have the flexibility to select their preferred criteria. We upload a Help guide with the software has been created to explain all the necessary details for applying filters during the process and to provide guidance on the essential requirements.
